# dots - the nix version
This repo aims to replace my existing [config_files](https://github.com/ethanholz/config_files) repo. This uses home-manager and Nix to manage not only installed packages but also dotfiles.

## Why?
The goal of this is to help further divorce my main system from what I use thus providing greater portability. Furthermore, Nix Flakes provide a way for me to distribute projects like [git-ce](https://github.com/ethanholz/git-ce) to my environments without the need for formal package management integrations.
