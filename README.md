# dots - the nix version
This uses home-manager and Nix to manage not only installed packages but also dotfiles.

## Why?
The goal of this is to help further divorce my main system from what I use thus providing greater portability. Furthermore, Nix Flakes provide a way for me to distribute projects like [git-ce](https://github.com/ethanholz/git-ce) to my environments without the need for formal package management integrations.

## Where is this hosted?
This code is hosted on both [tangled.sh](https://tangled.sh/@ethanholz.com/nix-config) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ethanholz/nix-config).
